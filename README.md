# SlimeFind
Tool to find Slime Chunks in Minecraft

Currently Functional, but WIP

Will Improve Later.

## SlimeFind.java
Need to use `javac` to compile to a runnable class file

Usage: `java SlimeFind <Numerical Seed> <X Coordinate> <Z Coordinate>`

Returns "true" if the chunk is a Slime Chunk and "false" if it is not.

You can get the numerical world seed in-game with the `/seed` command!

## Range.sh
BASH Shell Script that returns all Slime Chunks within a 500 Block Range of 0, 0

The coordinates it returns are the North Western corners of each Slime Chunk.
